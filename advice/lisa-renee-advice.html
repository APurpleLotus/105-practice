          <h2> Hello! My name is Lisa Renee (no it's my first and middle name not only my first). I thought I would share some advice that I've experimented with in my coding journey.</h2>

          <h3> Take Breaks! </h3>
          <p> Seriously. This is something I usually have to force myself to do. Taking breaks away from coding or from a project allows our brain to process what we're learning and what we've done. It allows us to come back to said project with a clear and open mind. Sometimes if stare at our projects for too long we start making mistakes and we get frustrated and wonder why isn't it working?! Yeah. So definitely go take a break and do something different. Like...</p>

          <h3> Drink Water... not just coffee or tea! Or Monsters...</h3>
          <p> Did you know our bodies are made of roughly 70-90% water? If you want more reasons to drink water, I found this <a href= "https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/why-is-water-important"> article from Healthline</a> giving you 16 reasons more to drink water and all the way at the end of the article is some recommendations about consumption. I'm not a doctor but I did think the article was helpful and interesting.</p>

          <h3> Move your body!</h3>
          <p> No you do not have to get on the floor and do a milllion push ups. But that being said, getting up and moving around at least a little bit has been known to improve cognitive function. That means our brains work better. Amazing! In addition to helping our brains out, moving around and not sitting for hours on end is also good for our heart and lungs. If you want more information about heart health, I recommend going to the <a href= "heart.org"> American Heart Association</a> website for information on the heart and moving your body more. Again not a doctor, but I do believe that the better care we take of our bodies, the better our brains will be able to code.</p>
