                <h4>Take breaks, not vacations!</h4>
                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was taking too much time off between my lessons. Lets face it, learning the command line can be so discouraging we probably would rather clean the entire house before sitting down to figure out how to deal with misplaced repos or mispellings in your commit messages. That said, my house has been tidier than usual for a while now...</p>

                <p>Since I am on my 3rd attempt to power through this GIT section, it felt like I'd already forgotten a lot of html and CSS! I figured this little project would be a great way to dust off some of my previously aquired skills, especially CSS. So as much as I want to half-ass this and move on, I think I need to put some thought into how I'd like to lay things out.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
