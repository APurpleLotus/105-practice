                <h4>You will be confused at first.</h4>
                <p>Like anything else you're learning for the very first time, it takes time to become acquainted with something new. Coding is a brand new language you are learning. All of the ins and outs, abbreviations, coder "slang" terms, etc are all foreign at first.</p>
 
                <p>Don't give up. Thousands of people from all walks of life learn to code every day. You can do this.</p>
 
                <h4>Be patient with yourself.</h4>
                <p>The most important advice I can give you is this: pace yourself. You will not learn this in a week, or a month. In order to retain information, you need to give yourself time to process everything you've just learned. Sometimes there would be a particular subject that would confuse me and I would need to take a break and think it over before I was ready to return to the computer and conquer my obstacle.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>Remember this- learning to code is well within your reach and you CAN do this!</p>
