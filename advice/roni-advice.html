                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>You are embarking on this adventure into the wonderful world of coding because you are choosing to do what is right for yourself, even though others in your life might not understand or appreciate it. That's okay; know that even though you might feel uncertain, you are on the right path.</p>

                <h4>Stay in <span>action</span>.</h4>
                <p>Learning to code for 5 minutes a day for a year will get you farther than thinking about learning to code for an hour every day, but never doing it.</p>

                <p>Action is what takes hopes and dreams and turns them into reality.</p>

                <p>Don't "should" on your self. The tortoise beats the hare every time. Small, consistent wins every day are better than huge wins for a few days followed by burnout.</p>
