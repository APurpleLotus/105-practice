                <h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>If you're totally lost, USE GOOGLE! Every developer does it. Even if they've been programming for years. It's just a great resource it should never be overlooked.</p>
 
                <h4>Copying is not "cheating".</h4>
                <p>If you see an awesome page or a neat navigation, don't be afraid to view source and copy the code. Every developer utilizes another's code and makes it their own. It's not "cheating" to have a template or something as a starting point to create your awesome site.</p>
