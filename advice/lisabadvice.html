                <h4>Create a schedule!</h4>
                <p>The best way to stay on track with your Skillcrush classes is by blocking out a time that fits your schedule to work on your class. Stick to this schedule as best as you can! </p>

                <p>When things get busy, it's easy to talk yourself out of working on your class, but if you have a schedule it's easier to stick to your goal of finishing!</p>

                <h4>Remember why you started!</h4>
                <p>When things get really challenging it can be hard to stick to it! Remember why you started! Is it for a new career? To learn skills for a promotion? To make more money? Keep these at the front of your brain to remind you to keep going!</p>

                <p>Read some motivating books to build your confidence. I really liked <span>Grit</span>, <span>Deep Work</span>, and <span>Atomic Habits</span>. These helped me get in the right mindset for learning challenging things.</p>
