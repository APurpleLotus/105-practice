                            to write your first programming language, or just the lastest framework,
                            you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the
                            code that you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand
                            HOW exactly it's happening.

                            You see when you encounter a new programming language part of
                            your learning process includes learning to train your eye. 
                            The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even 
                            when you don't totally understand what it's doing.
