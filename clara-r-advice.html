                <h4>Confusion is normal!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and can be somewhat nervewracking.</p>

                <p>But, it's a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. Just be patient.</p>

                <h4>Keep Going!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. It will sink in to get to that "Ah ha" moment.</p>
