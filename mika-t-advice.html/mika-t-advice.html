                <h4>Whatever you do, don't give up!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge and a new opportunity, which can be exciting at first! But with anything new, confusion can set in and finding clarity on how to code can be daunting.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Learn to find comfort in being uncomfortable.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new skill like programming languages, whether you are learning to HTML, or CSS, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you understand the code you are reading but have trouble when it comes to laying out the code on your own from scratch.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
