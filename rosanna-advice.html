    <h1>Coding is a rewarding journey!</h1>
      <p>I would be lying to you if I told you that learning to code is going to be easy! No, it is going to be a very difficult process. However, you will find many rewarding moments during the journey. Things will begin to make more sense. Then, just when you are starting to consider yourself a pro, you will have to learn something completely new. You will always be a beginner and that will be the most rewarding part of your journey. Never stop learning! </p>
